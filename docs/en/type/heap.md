## Heap
Usage of `algo.type.MinHeap` is same as `algo.type.MaxHeap`, except the constructor. 
Notice, there is a pseudo element at `heap[0]` which we might not use.

The reason we do not implement public `forEach`, `map` or `toArray` is 
that any of these function will destroy the heap.

#### `isEmpty(): boolean`
Returns `true` if there is no real element in `heap`, otherwise `false`.
#### `size(): number`
Gets the number of elements in `heap`.
#### `push(any): number`
Inserts an element into the `heap`, and gets `size()` of the new `heap`.
#### `pop(): any`
Get the max element from `MaxHeap`, or the min element from `MinHeap`, 
the remove it, keeping `heap` sorted.
#### `minheap.update(key, when, how): boolean`
Finds an elem holding `key(x)`:
* if it exists, and it holds `when(x)`, its value will be update by `how(x)`, 
  and `true` will be returned as an indicator for 'element found';
* if it doesn't hold `when(x)`, `true` will be returned also as an indicator for 'element found';
* otherwise, return `false` as an indicator for 'no element found'.

This method will be applied in `Dijkstra` algorithm.

The details of parameters is:

```JavaScript
minheap.update(
  key: x => boolean, 
  when: x => boolean, 
  how: x => void): boolean
```
